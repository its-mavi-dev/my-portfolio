# My Portfolio

For my portfolio and web presence, it's clean, simple, and straight to the point.

A website such as this one was designed to showcase my portfolio and establish a presence online.

It is simple, straightforward, and straight to the point which I have tried to keep as clean, simple, and efficient as I can.

All my projects & their GitHub repo links, as well as my information about who I am and what I do, can be found here.

Additionally, you can find all my social media links in the footer of the website.

You can check out the Live Link to see the Project.
